# Todos
## - Read about Auth object, and app object, and the initialization process. First in the video linked in the source, then in the docs (read about the auth object, the objects returned by all initializers, and the params of all initializers)
## - Look into linking multiple accounts / linking email account to google account etc. 
## - Add sign in with google to the firebaseui sign up
## - Explore more firebaseui stuff here: https://firebaseopensource.com/projects/firebase/firebaseui-web/
## - Do a test of getting the auth'd user (redirect after )
## - Look into conditional rendering and conditional routing... is somebody signed in or not? 
         - How is this typically done in react?
         - How does firebase suggest doing this?
         - If nothing promising, just go forward with trying to get the auth'd user...
## - Start rebuilding the UI around sign in and signed in flow...
